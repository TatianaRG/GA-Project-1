# GA SEI Project 1 : SPACE INVADERS
---
## Overview
SPACE INVADERS was my first (solo) project completed on General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, and was my first attempt at using JavaScript.
The timeframe for completing the project was 7 days.

### HOW TO PLAY
For the uninitiated, SPACE INVADERS is a classic 80s arcade game requiring the player (spaceship) to shoot down the invading aliens to score points before they reach the bottom of the screen.
